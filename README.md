## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The patterns of component composition were highly inspired by [Radius 1.0](https://github.com/rangle/radius) and [Varun Vacchar](https://github.com/winkerVSbecks)'s opinions on using [Styled Components and Styled System](https://varun.ca/styled-system/).
